-------- Staves!! the mainstay. --------
    Extended(?) - DONE
        Normal staff but lorj, offers slightly more grid space (configurable)
        maybe I should change the lang for hex's staves to "wands" instead of calling it extended
	Notes:
	""like the long staves would come with 1 level of a grid expanding enchant for free, but
	you could still go out and apply the enchant manually if you wanted to use one of the
	small staves and get the same functionality"" -Chloe


    Impermanent Staff / Improviser's Staff - DONE
        staff made from amethyst, for people who didn't bring wood into the geode
        - has a media buffer (like a phial, implements MediaHolderItem)
        - breaks like a cypher (cannot be recharged)

    Drawing Orb - DONE
        staff with less grid space
        - you can set it to scry/ponder a position
        - extends ambit to a single entity(?) or block
        - ambit is only granted when the orb is held (in either hand)

        - needs a music disc (or similar expensive item) to craft along with
        - cannot be cast from while in the grid

	alternatively, instead of the

---------Other Hex gear and trinkets --------
    Caster's Head Mirror:
	head trinket, based on the old doctor's headband
	- maybe reflects raycasts?

    Charged Amethyst Diadem:
	- crafted with an empty diadem and charged
	- amethyst on it shatters to prevent hex-related damage 
	    - one-time, turns back into empty diadem after (recraft)

	- can be made pre-enlighten but is decorative at first, like slates

    Budding Amethyst Diadem: (bud diadem)
        a headband that grows tiny clusters from its wearer's brain activity
        - doing certain things can make it briefly go faster (qualia)

    Bloodletter's Diadem: (blood diadem)

	- keeps the wearer below a set amount of health, and refunds it as media
	    - grants more media per hp the lower the limit is (player chooses limit)
	        - range is 1/hp to 2/hp? tentative

	- "it aches, OH HOW IT **ACHES**, but it fills my pockets..."
	- might charge to an internal reservoir, or to held items like rumination
	    - choose which depending on what was flaid (base vs phial one?)

Hex Gear: Rings!
    - one to make a given spell cheaper
	- write a spell pattern to it, reduces the cost

	- call it the "Ring of Signature Spells"? (D&D reference)
	
    - Silk Touch/Fortune rings (modifies break block)
	- made obselete by hexical patterns, though may be useful for not incurring cost
