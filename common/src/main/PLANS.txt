Staves!! long ones!!

types:
    Extended(?)
        Normal staff but lorj, offers slightly more grid space (configurable)
        maybe I should change the lang for hex's staves to "wands" instead of calling it great

    Grand/Great(?) Staves
        has ItemPackagedHex (is a casting device) BUT:
        - does not have a media buffer of its own
        - has a chargeup time to cast its bound hex(?), as well as the usual cooldown
        - needs a music disc (or similar expensive item) to craft along with
        Maybe takes the form of being etched into the wood, a trusty hex the wielder knows by heart

    Reverberating Staff
        depend on Oneironaut/Nova's addon, casts the hex every tick
        - maybe add an extra couple flow control patterns
        - require a reverb rod in the recipe ofc
