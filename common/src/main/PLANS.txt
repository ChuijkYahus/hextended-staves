Staves!! long ones!!

    Extended(?) - DONE
        Normal staff but lorj, offers slightly more grid space (configurable)
        maybe I should change the lang for hex's staves to "wands" instead of calling it extended

    Impermanent Staff / Improviser's Staff - DONE
        staff made from amethyst, for people who didn't bring wood into the geode
        - has a media buffer (like a phial, implements MediaHolderItem)
        - breaks like a cypher (cannot be recharged)

    Drawing Orb
        staff with less grid space
        - you can set it to scry/ponder a position
        - extends ambit in (3-4?) sphere, but ONLY to entities
        - or a single block

    Crossmod Staves
        mostly cosmetic, for aesthetic matching
        - Ice and Fire
            - dragonscale,
        - Botania
            - manasteel, terrasteel, elementium, livingrock, livingwood and dreamwood
        - Ars Nouveau? (no, added by Ars Scalaes)

	The Old Serpent on discord requested "Bewitchment, Haema, and the entire Spell Engine Suite ... The Graveyard might be interesting too .."
        gchpaco suggested Hexerei. that's a good one.


    Other Staves
	    - spoon staff but the extended version is comically large
		    "this staff's name is 'Spoon Theory' look him up on google"
	    - also moss staff. need. flowering azalea variants. maybe an glow berrie?
	    - prismarine staves for matching to aquatic players, dark variant
	    - copper staves?
	    - nether-related staves (not quartz, sam covered that), netherrack?
	    - end staves > purpur, obsidian?`1	

    Grand/Great(?) Staves
        implements ItemPackagedHex (is a casting device) BUT:
        - does not have a media buffer of its own
        - has a chargeup time to cast its bound hex(?), as well as the usual cooldown
        - needs a music disc (or similar expensive item) to craft along with
        - cannot be cast from while in the grid
        Maybe takes the form of being etched into the wood, a trusty hex the wielder knows by heart
	alternatively, instead of the 

    Reverberating Staff
        depend on Oneironaut/Nova's addon, casts the hex every tick
        - maybe add an extra couple flow control patterns
        - require a reverb rod in the recipe ofc

    Notes:
    ""like the long staves would come with 1 level of a grid expanding enchant for free, but
     you could still go out and apply the enchant manually if you wanted to use one of the
     small staves and get the same functionality"" -Chloe

    



Misc hex gear:

    Charged Amethyst Diadem:
        mechanics related to bloodcasting
        - makes bloodcasting more feasible, possibly increasing the amount
         of media one can get out of their health
        - malleability theme, some event will progressively increase its capacity
            - flay minds into it? staffcasted patterns increase by a small bit?
