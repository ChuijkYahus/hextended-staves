Staves!! long ones!!

    Extended(?) - DONE
        Normal staff but lorj, offers slightly more grid space (configurable)
        maybe I should change the lang for hex's staves to "wands" instead of calling it extended

    Impermanent Staff / Improviser's Staff - DONE
        staff made from amethyst, for people who didn't bring wood into the geode
        - has a media buffer (like a phial, implements MediaHolderItem)
        - breaks like a cypher (cannot be recharged)

    Drawing Orb - DONE
        staff with less grid space
        - you can set it to scry/ponder a position
        - extends ambit to a single entity(?) or block
        - ambit is only granted when the orb is held (in either hand)

    Crossmod Staves
        mostly cosmetic, for aesthetic matching
        - Botania

            - livingrock, livingwood and dreamwood
        - Gloop's staves
	    - Spectrum
            - azurite (suggested by pantheon)

        - Hexerei (suggested by gchpaco)

    Other Staves - DONE
	    - spoon staff but the extended version is comically large
		    "this staff's name is 'Spoon Theory' look him up on google"
	    - also moss staff. need. flowering azalea variants. maybe an glow berrie?
	    - prismarine staves for matching to aquatic players, dark variant
	    - copper staves?
	    - nether-related staves (not quartz, sam covered that), netherrack?
	    - end staves > purpur, obsidian?

    Combat Staves!
        staves with small attack damage bonuses, made from specific materials
        iron combat staff, caster's glamour to change skins
        - "caster's caestus", amethyst mace, tonfa-like, baton,
        - dancer sword w/ shards as blades

    Grand/Great(?) Staves
        implements ItemPackagedHex (is a casting device) BUT:
        - does not have a media buffer of its own
        - has a chargeup time to cast its bound hex(?), as well as the usual cooldown
        - needs a music disc (or similar expensive item) to craft along with
        - cannot be cast from while in the grid
        Maybe takes the form of being etched into the wood, a trusty hex the wielder knows by heart
	alternatively, instead of the 

    Reverberating Staff
        depend on Oneironaut/Miyu's addon, casts the hex every tick
        - maybe add an extra couple flow control patterns
        - require a reverb rod in the recipe ofc

    Notes:
    ""like the long staves would come with 1 level of a grid expanding enchant for free, but
     you could still go out and apply the enchant manually if you wanted to use one of the
     small staves and get the same functionality"" -Chloe



Bookbinding! Customized spellbooks
    Custom Spellbooks that have varying page counts, but with other effects
    - spellbook with lessened pages, but built-in hexbook (rmb opens patchouli book)
    - similar spellbook, that opens a book-and-quill on rmb
    - spellbooks can be made with a specific number of pages

    - crafted from a base item (empty cover)
    - shapeless recipe like a firework to add features
        - focus for 8 pages,
        - & other items for <8
            - (4,2,1?) for granularity
        - hexbook for hexbook on rmb
        - book and quill for gui on rmb
            - maybe make this its own page
              so it has compat with scribes etc
        - artifact maybe? but idk if balanced


    - use nbt data to store rclick action & page count
    

---------Other hex gear:--------

    Caster's Head Mirror:
	head trinket, based on the old doctor's headband
	- maybe reflects raycasts?

    Charged Amethyst Diadem:
        a wearable phial? maybe an inert bud diadem that needs another step to craft?
        - no item flaying? use an akashic record for the recipe, make flaying required that way!

    Budding Amethyst Diadem: (bud diadem)
        a headband that grows tiny clusters from its wearer's brain activity
        - doing certain things can make it briefly go faster (qualia)

    Bloodletter's Diadem: (blood diadem)
        mechanics related to bloodcasting, made using the bud diadem
        - makes bloodcasting more feasible, possibly increasing the amount
         of media one can get out of their health
        -- malleability theme, some event will progressively increase its capacity
        -- flay minds into it? staffcasted patterns increase by a small bit?
        --- could have a health HUD overlay, amethyst dust sprinkled on top of one's hearts

Hex Gear: Rings!
    - one to make Overgrowth cheaper (and maybe some for others)
    - Silk Touch/Fortune rings (make them work in the offhand as well, for automation)
    - reach ring, that adds some proportion of your reach distance to your ambit
        could be a hand slot item


Hex Gear: Armor!
    Chloe suggested armor that moves the play:
    - Boots have a spell to jump,
    - Leggings can make you walk,
    - Chestplate can make you right-click/punch
    - Helmet can make you... look?     

QUALIA (kwah-lee-uh):
    a multiplicative bonus stat with beneficial effects, like a Hexing Streak! tm
    Qualia is increased by:
        - staffcasting
        - bloodcasting(?)
        - activating spell circles
