# Hextended Staves

Bolsters your magic stick collection.

An arsenal-based Hex Casting addon making use of the template created by ArtyNova, object-Object, and others. Special Thanks to everyone on the Hex Casting Discord server for answering all my questions, you all gave me the energy to make this.

This is my first time making a minecraft mod, and as such it's been a thorough learning experience. I question the validity of this repo being public for the sole reason of my uncertainty in being able to patch any reported bugs... but that's not something I plan to be eternally true. Currently, all it adds are some looonger casting staves. They give just a tad more grid space and are quite large. In the works are more staves, drawing instruments in general, and some other hex gear.

Little disclaimer, most of the code here is either written by example or is taken from others in the Hex Casting community with permission, mainly from samsthenerd. BIGGEST kudos to her for answering my questions and pointing me to the right places. I want to try to use my own code, and maybe I'll refactor/rewrite using my own understanding later, but there aren't many different paths you can take with modding, and Sam has paved the yellow brick road.
